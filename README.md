I'm a front-end web developer and business developer working in the field of hobby crafts and textiles. 

Trained as a programmer, I started a website selling yarn and fiber when I moved to a location where tech jobs were scarce back in the days of the dinosaurs and no remote working.

It's become a passion, and while I still work on various development and UI/UX projects, at least part of my time is spent developing businesses and courses on making soft, wooly things in the fiber arts realm.

Skills: HTML / CSS / JS / PHP and flavors of each

Working on: Employment acquisition.

Learning: React.js specifically with intentions to continue in PERN stack.
